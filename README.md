# README
The codes in this library are intended for submission to Computers and Geosciences journals.
The functions are adaptive hybrid algorithm fast forward modeling and grounded electrical-source TEM forward modeling, respectively. 
According to the prompts in the program, inputting and running parameters can obtain 1D response curve.
The main program is SATEM-For.m, OptimizationAlgorithm. m, and comparat_time. m. 
The additional .m files serve as sub-functions called by the main program. 
The .txt file contains fixed coefficients that facilitate easy reading by the program.
All programs need to be run in MATLAB 2019b and above versions.
For a detailed description of the code, please refer to the documentation file Code Description.docx.
