# README
The main program includes OptimizationAlgorithm. m and SATEM-For. m. 
The functions are adaptive hybrid algorithm fast forward modeling and grounded electrical-source TEM forward modeling, respectively. 
According to the prompts in the program, inputting and running parameters can obtain 1D response curve.
All programs need to be run in MATLAB 2019b and above versions.
